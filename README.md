# footwear_classfier
CNN-based footwear classifier

I built a custom CNN from scratch: a footwear classifer which identifies sneakers, heels, boots, and sandles with 87% accuracy. 

I webscraped approximately 1200 product images from Amazon and also applied transfer-learning using a headless ResNet, which boosted the accuracy further to 93% accuracy. The final tool utilizes your laptopâ€™s camera to capture images in real-time and accurately classify them!
